`lmstudio.js` is LM Studio's Typescript SDK. It is currently in pre-release alpha, which means we are still iterating and changing APIs frequently.

If this doesn't concern you, you're welcome to go ahead and use `lmstudio.js` ðŸ¦¾.

```lms_notice
`lmstudio.js` is Apache-2.0 licensed and is developed here: https://github.com/lmstudio-ai/lmstudio.js.
```

<hr>

The best way to learn about `lmstudio.js` is by reading the README as well as the code on the github repository.

Expect this section of the documentation to evolve rapidly as we stabilize the API.
